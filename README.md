### Howdy

I am an interdisciplinary health informatician with a background in disease surveillance. I help people understand the big picture and make better decisions for their clients.

Since I was young, I took pride knowing my 'thing' was the passion to learn & here we are. Currently teaching myself R, SQL, PowerBI, ArcGIS Pro, Git and GitHub in my free time. 

So stay tuned; growth to come.
